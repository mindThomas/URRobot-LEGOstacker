- In Vmware network settings select NAT Vmware vmnet 8
- In Matlab being server mode: No need to setup an ip setting in polyscope. Just make sure your server accepts connection from any address. It works with Matlab and python both. Tested!
In Polyscope see ip from vm1 windows connections, possibly 192.169.73.1, port 30000
- In Matlab being client mode: see ip by right clicking on network button in ubuntu; set polyscope ip appropriately. Use probably:(192.168.220.131) port 30002
